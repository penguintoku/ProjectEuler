My Solution to HackerRank in Java (and Java only).

Trust me, not a weird site.

##Why in Java?
Very good question. Will, if you did it in C++ where there is
"unsigned int/long", it's pretty easy to pass the test cases for very
large numbers. However, Java doesn't support "unsigned" types so the only way
you can pass those cases are using BigIntegers. I was rusty on using BigIntegers
since, we rarely use it in our class projects or so. Weak reason right?

Have Fun!

##Credits
Some of the solution, I have taken parts from the internet. I have included the
sites where I have taken them.
