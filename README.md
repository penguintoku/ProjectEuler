My Solution to HackerRank in Java: ProjectEuler+ from https://projecteuler.net/

Why did I do it in Java? Very good question. Will, if you did it C++ where
there is "unsigned int/long", it's pretty easy to pass the test cases for very
large numbers. However, Java doesn't support "unsigned" types so the only way
you can pass those cases are using BigIntegers. I was rusty on using BigIntegers
since, we rarely use it in our class projects or so.

Have Fun!
